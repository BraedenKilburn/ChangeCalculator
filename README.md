# ChangeCalculator

This calculator will ask for the total due and the payment total given. Using this information, it will calculate how much change is due to the customer and will inform you how to give the change (i.e., which coins/bills).

## Note (07/19/2021)
This calculator is wrong on occasion, I will fix it someday.
